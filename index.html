    Across countless neighborhoods, vital infrastructure and public services are falling through the cracks. 
    From leaking water pipes and hazardous potholes to overflowing dumpsters and broken streetlights, these everyday issues silently pile up—unseen by the right people, unaddressed for far too long. 
    <br>The core problem? Outdated reporting systems, lack of responsiveness, and a disconnect between citizens and those responsible for maintaining their environments.
    <br>Residents are often left feeling powerless, unsure of who to contact, or convinced their concerns won’t make a difference. Over time, this leads to frustration, deteriorating trust in local governance, and communities that look and feel neglected. The result is more than just physical decline—it’s a growing sense that voices aren’t being heard and that change is out of reach.
